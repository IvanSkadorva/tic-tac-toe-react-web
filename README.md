# Realtime Tic Tac Toe React App

This React app is used to test the React Native version of this tic tac toe game. In the React Native app, players are able to create unqiue game channels where others players can join (total of 2 players per channel room). In this React app, players join a game channel that was created by another player. Once two players are connected to a channel, the game starts. We will use PubNub to power the realtime infrastructure of the game.
